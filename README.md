# Projects

1. Machine Learning Based Predictions for Crime rate in Chicago	 (January 2018-April 2018)
-	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly libraries in Python for Crime Type, Location between years 2003-2016
-	Performed Missing Data Analysis, Featuring Engineering, and Feature Selection using Tpot, Boruta, and Recursive feature elimination to obtain the best features for prediction.
-	Build five prediction models: - Extra Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regressor, BernoulliNB, K-Nearest Neighbor, pickled all the models and uploaded them to Amazon S3
-	Build python Flask Application which allowed single entry form with relevant features, performed predictions in Back-End using pickled models from S3 and predicted whether Arrest should be made or not
-	Predicted whether a District is safe or not, based on Crime Rate and Arrest Rate

2. Default Credit Card Client Analysis (April 2018)
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset using Python libraries to analyze payment trends of the client
- Implemented predictive analysis on default credit card client and analyzed whether client would be able to pay next month payment or not using Classification algorithm where Extra Trees Classifier gave the accuracy of 89%
- Developed Web application using Flask for making single and bulk entries to give prediction to the user 

3. Edgar Dataset Analysis   (Feb 2018) 
- Generated the required URL using BeautifulSoup for the given year to get log file of the first day of every month and preprocessed the    loaded data using Python libraries 
- Computed summary metrics, automated the pipeline by building Docker image and uploaded it to Amazon S3 bucket  

4. U.S Pollution Analysis   (Jan 2018)
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset using Python libraries to analyze increase in pollution 
- Implemented predictive analysis on pollutants and analyzed the rate of pollutants over years using Linear Regression and Polynomial  Regression in Jupyter Notebook 
- Compared models and identified Polynomial regression predicted dataset with low RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). Visualized the analyzed data results using Matplotlib and Seaborn 
 
5. Inventory Management System    (Nov 2017-Dec 2017)
- Created system in MySQL to manage inventory sales efficiently and visualized data using Tableau 
- Executed triggers, stored procedures, functions to answer questions about the database  
 
6. Alcohol Addiction Detection and Recovery based Application      (Oct 2017-Dec 2017) 
- Designed ecosystem-level application in Java to identify harmful patterns of alcohol consumption by using weighted average score.  Created UI using Java Swing components
- Generated visualization reports using JFree charts and created back-end database using DB4O
